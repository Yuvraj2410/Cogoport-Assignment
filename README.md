# Configuration Management System API

## Overview

This project is a robust and scalable FastAPI application designed to manage a Configuration Management System for onboarding organizations from different countries. The API supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing country-specific configurations.

## Features

1. **CRUD Operations**: Provides endpoints to create, read, update, and delete configurations.
2. **Data Validation**: Utilizes Pydantic models for request and response validation.
3. **Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error handling using FastAPI's exception mechanisms.
4. **Database Integration**: Uses PostgreSQL as the database with SQLAlchemy ORM for data persistence.
5. **Security**: Database connection details are managed using environment variables.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Functionality

- **Correctness of CRUD Operations**: Each endpoint correctly performs the desired operation on the configuration data.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures incoming data is validated to prevent incorrect data from being processed.

### 2. Code Structure

- **Readability**: The code is well-commented and uses descriptive names for variables and functions.
- **Maintainability**: Modular design separates concerns, making the code easier to maintain and extend.
- **Modularity**: Functions and classes are designed to be reusable and self-contained.

### 3. Error Handling

- **Robustness**: Handles various error conditions gracefully.
- **Informative Error Messages**: Provides clear and helpful error messages for different failure scenarios.

### 4. Documentation

- **Clear and Concise API Documentation**: Each endpoint is documented with its purpose, request parameters, and expected responses.
- **Docstrings and Comments**: The code includes docstrings and comments to explain its behavior and purpose.

### 5. Database Schema Design

- **Understanding**: The schema is designed to handle country-specific configuration requirements efficiently.
- **Data Types**: Appropriate data types are used for each field to ensure data integrity.

### 6. Product Requirements and Scenarios

- **Scenarios Handled**: Various scenarios like creating new configurations, updating existing ones, and handling missing data are covered.
